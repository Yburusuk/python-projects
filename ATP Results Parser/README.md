This project is a parser for ATP Tour tournaments.
It gets the draw table of the tournaments and creates an Excel file that includes every player and where they ended up in the tournament.
It excludes "special" tournaments such as ATP Finals, ATP Cup, Olympics etc.
It also excludes the cancelled tournaments, there are a lot of tournaments which are cancelled in 2020-2021 period because of the pandemic.
